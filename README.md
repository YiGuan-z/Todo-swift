# TODO

最近刚刚学习了Swift并且尝试用它编写我的第一个App，至于为什么是TODO App，因为我不知道写什么。

因为是练手，所以这个就到这里结束了吧，倒是工具编写得不错，我去找找大佬们的设计，自己写出来的页面看着好丑。

## 功能

- [👍] MarkDown文本展示
- [👍] 计划事件的添加
- []  计划任务的页面展示

# TODO

I recently learned Swift and tried to write my first App with it. As for why it's a TODO App, it's because I don't know what to write.

“Since it’s just for practice, I guess this is where it ends. The tool was well-written though. I’ll go look for designs from the pros, because the pages I wrote myself look so ugly.”

## Features

- [👍] Markdown text display
- [👍] Adding scheduled events
- []  Display of scheduled tasks page
